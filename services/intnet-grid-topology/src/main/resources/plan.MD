# Microservice Architecture:

## Grid Topology Service:

Responsibility: Manages the graph representation of the grid.
Database: Neo4j (for graph structure).   
Functionality:
Stores and retrieves grid topology (nodes, edges, connectivity).
Provides APIs for graph traversals and queries.   
Updates topology based on grid changes.
Grid Data Service:

Responsibility: Manages both fixed and real-time properties of grid elements.
Database: PostgreSQL (for structured data).
Functionality:
Stores and retrieves fixed properties (capacity, location, etc.).
Stores and updates real-time measurements (voltage, current, power flow, DER output, etc.).
Provides APIs for accessing property data.
Potentially integrates with message queues for real-time data ingestion.
Forecasting Service:

Responsibility: Generates short-term and long-term forecasts of grid parameters (load, generation, DER output).
Functionality:
Uses time-series analysis, machine learning models, or other forecasting techniques.
Consumes data from the Grid Data Service.
Publishes forecasts to other services (e.g., Control Service).   
Potentially integrates with message queues for forecast updates.
Control Service:

Responsibility: Executes control actions to optimize grid operation.
Functionality:
Implements control algorithms (e.g., optimal power flow, voltage control).
Consumes forecasts from the Forecasting Service.
Interacts with grid devices (via communication interfaces).
Uses data from the Grid Data Service.
May use numerical methods or GNNs for control optimization.
GNN Inference Service:

Responsibility: Runs GNN models for specific grid analysis or control tasks.
Functionality:
Hosts trained GNN models.
Receives graph data from the Grid Topology Service and property data from the Grid Data Service.
Performs inference and returns results (e.g., node classifications, link predictions, control actions).
Can be invoked by other services (e.g., Control Service).
Simulation Service:

Responsibility: Simulates grid behavior under different scenarios.
Functionality:
Uses power system simulation tools (e.g., PowerFactory, RTDS).
Receives grid topology and property data.
Simulates grid response to events (e.g., DER outages, load changes).
Provides simulation results to other services (e.g., Control Service, Forecasting Service).
Data Ingestion Service:

Responsibility: Collects real-time data from grid devices.
Functionality:
Connects to various communication protocols (e.g., IEC 61850, DNP3).
Normalizes and validates data.
Publishes data to message queues (e.g., Kafka).
Potentially stores historical data in a time-series database.
API Gateway:

Responsibility: Provides a unified interface for all microservices.
Functionality:
Handles authentication and authorization.
Routes requests to the appropriate microservices.
Performs rate limiting and other security measures.
